How the fuck are you supposed to know if it's the right time?
These days, I can never keep up with the life style
mostly, I've been doing things on my own
Time, I still don't know how to tell
She love it the money, how do I know that it's not just the money
Shit, it's not even funny, how do I know that I'm not in my feelings?
Feel it right in my body, why am I fighting the fighting?
Now I'm caught in my money, I don't really need a problem in my way
I could go where I wanna, but I really need to travel to LA
I could be where I wanna, but I really need to go to move away
I could go where I wanna go, just get on my way
